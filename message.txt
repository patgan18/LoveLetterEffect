# My Beloved Yan,

I hope it makes sense now why I told you I was studying. As I write this, you probably have no idea that I am learning how to code -- or at least steal other people's code, customize it, then run it on a separate platform.

If there's one thing the past month with you has taught me, it's to do things I never once thought I'd be doing. From taking a car ride at 4AM and traveling for four hours just to spend two perfect hours with you, to learning how to code, I'm sure it will be all worth it.

It will all be worth it - is what I tell myself everyday, and I have no trouble convincing myself that this is true. You have made me the happiest person with your gentle love, you've made me realize how big the world truly is, and you make everyday so much brighter with your presence.

To find you and be found by you is a miracle I did not think myself worthy of receiving -- and I will spend everyday proving myself worthy of the gift of you. Happy Valentine's Day, my Yan. I love you.

Always Yours,

Pat
